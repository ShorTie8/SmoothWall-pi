These are the general steps to take to build, prepare, test and release an
update. It is left to the maintainer to determine where uploaded update files
are found (there are only two places).

The update build now uses the main build system to compile pkgs and prepare
their 'release' tarballs. The update assembly generally determines which files
will be included in the patch.

The update build can now use a 'pkg'.list file for each pkg to control which
of the pkg's files are included in the update. There is a 'pre-tar-setup'
script that will tidy the distrib tree just before it is tarred up. Create
these files as needed.


Update Development Tools
------------------------
  - checklibs: this tool checks every shared lib needed by every program.
    Note: it should also check shared libs needed by shared libs. It should
    also report shared libs that are apparently not used by anything; these
    shuold be deleted from the system.


Update info file format
-----------------------
  MD5:      The md5sum of the complete update tarball.
  Size:     The size in bytes of the patch tarball inside the update archive.
  Info URL: Typically an URL to the forum describing the update.


Update build steps
------------------
  - When releasing a service pack, add the update's release date to
    .../coretree/tree/var/smoothwall/patches/installed. And don't
    forget to update it if the update takes a long time to complete.
  - Add pkgs to build for the update to the update's makefile.
  - Add coretree files to coretree.list, one file per line, if any.
  - NOTE: !!! If dhcpcd is included, be sure to include usr/etc/dhcpcd.conf. !!!
  - Create 'pkg'.list file to constrain which of an updated pkg's files
    are added to the update
  - Go to the main .../build/... directory
  - Execute "UPDATE=n make update" where 'n' is the number of the update.


Update preparation steps
------------------------
  - Prepare update
  - Upload inspection packet to internet somewhere (typically
    downloads.smoothwall.org/update-testing/)
  - Post link to it in the update planning thread
  - Repeat as necessary


Update release steps
--------------------
  - Edit info.* to include the current update's description, MD5sum, date,
    patch size, and forum URL
  - Run:
      scp Express-3.1-Update1-*.tar.gz \
        "username@web.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/smoothwall/SmoothWall\ Updates/3.1"
    for EACH architecture (i586 and x86_64).
  - Run:
      for i in i586 x86_64; do
        scp info-$i "fest3er@web.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/smoothwall/updateInfo/3.1-polar-$i/info"
      done
  - Edit /var/www/downloads.smoothwall.org/.htaccess (on downloads.sw.org) and add a permanent
    redirect (301) for each arch's update.


Post-release
------------
  - Add an announcement to the announcements forum
  - Send a request to Towers to add the update notice to www.smoothwall.org.
