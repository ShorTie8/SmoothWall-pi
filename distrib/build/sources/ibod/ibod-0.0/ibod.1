.SH NAME
ibod \- ISDN MPPP bandwidth on demand daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibod

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ibod
is a ISDN MPPP bandwidth on demand daemon designed to operate
in conjunction with
.B isdn4linux.
It is normally started at boot time, but can be started and stopped
at any time. The program monitors inbound and outbound traffic on
the ISDN interface. When the required bandwidth exceeds the capacity
for one IDSN B-channel (64kbps) a second (slave) channel is connected
according to the MPPP protocol. When the traffic decreases below
one channel capacity, the slave channel is disconnected.
.PP
A configuration file
.I /etc/ppp/ibod.cf
is read initially.
The device
.I /dev/isdninfo
is monitored for the current state and throughput of the ISDN interface.
All operation on the ISDN interface is made through the
.I /dev/isdnctrl
interface.
.PP
.B Ibod
is also listening on TCP port 6050 for eventual connection from control
panel
.Bxibod(1).

.SH SIGNALS
Upon receiving SIGHUP, the configuration file is re-read.
A SIGPIPE closes an eventual socket connection with
.B xibod.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Variable
.I IBOD_HOME
specifies the directory where to look for the
configuration file
.I ibod.cf.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All logging is made to syslog with the identity tag
.I ibod.
