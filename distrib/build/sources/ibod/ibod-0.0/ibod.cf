#
# DEVICE	<name>	Name of ISDN PPP device.
#			Default is ippp0.
#
# ENABLE	1|0	Enable/disable bandwidth-on-demand.
#			Default is enable (1).
#
# INTERVAL	<n>	Specify the sample time interval in ms.
#			Default is 500 ms.
#
# FILTER	<n>	Defines "filtering factor". A value of 10 means
#			that the average bytes/sec value measured over 10
#			intervals must pass the limit defined by LIMIT

# LIMIT		<n>	Transfer rate limit in bytes/sec for bringing
#			up or down isdn slave channel.
#			Default is 7000.
#
# STAYUP	0|1	Enable/disable slave channel stay up function.
#			If enabled the 2:nd cannel (slave link) will stay
#			up even if the average bytes/sec decrease the value
#			defined by LIMIT. In this case the slave link will
#			stay up until hangup time is reached.
#			(Example: isdnctrl huptimeout ippp1 60)
#			If disabled the slave link will be brought down in
#			the same way it is brought up.
#			Default is 0.
#
