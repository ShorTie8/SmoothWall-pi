.SS OPTIONS

.TP
.I DEVICE <name>
Name of ISDN PPP device. Default is ippp0.

.TP
.I ENABLE 1|0
Enable/disable bandwidth-on-demand.  Default is enable (1).

.TP
.I INTERVAL <n>
Specify the sample time interval in ms.  Default is 500 ms.

.TP
.I FILTER <n>
Defines "filtering factor". A value of 10 means

If enabled, the 2:nd cannel (slave link) will stay
up even if the average bytes/sec decrease the value
defined by LIMIT. In this case the slave link will
stay up until hangup time is reached.
(Example: isdnctrl huptimeout ippp1 60)
If disabled the slave link will be brought down in
the same way it was brought up.
Default is 0.
