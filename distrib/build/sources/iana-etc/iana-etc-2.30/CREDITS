The iana-etc maintainer is Seth W. Klein <sk@sethwklein.net>.

Thanks go to all the Linux From Scratch users who wrote the scripts that
inspired the, now obsolete, LFS HINT and who reported bugs against that HINT.

Thanks also go to the following people who have reported bugs in iana-etc
or made feature requests.
