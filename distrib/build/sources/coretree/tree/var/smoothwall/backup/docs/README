To auto-run the daemon at startup, append the following to /etc/inittab:

----snip----
# Run the backup daemon
BD:12345:respawn:/usr/bin/backup_daemon
# Run the backup Monitor on tty11
BM:12345:respawn:/usr/bin/backup_mon </dev/tty11 >/dev/tty11 2>/dev/tty11
----snip----

Use a different TTY as you prefer. Then 'init q' to make it take effect.

The default is to back up files at 1AM. Edit /var/smoothwall/backup/settings to
change (for normal systems) timeINCREMENTAL, timeFULL and/or (for AGCL/FW)
timeVARTOTAL. Valid values are 'at' or 'now'. Change delayUntil to change the
time when the backup will run if you have chosen 'at'; be careful: 'now'
really means 'the next time this hour:minute occurs.'

The default is to back up the entire tree. Modify toSAVE and toSKIP in the
settings file to change the files and folders that are included and excluded
from the backup. Each variable is a space-separated list of absolute path
names (beginning with a '/').

Pert near any medium that can be hot-plugged can be used for backup. Best
tested are hot-plugged SATA drives and USB thumb drives. External USB, SATA,
IDE, and FireWire drives should work well.

Standard GNU/Linux filesystems should work well; EXT[234] and VFAT have been
tested. Be aware that NTFS can be problematic. Be sure you've installed
NTFS-3G so the backup system will have read/write access to the filesystem.

WARNING: VFAT limits maximum file size to 4GiB. If your archive will be larger,
you are advised to use another filesystem; the EXT[234] family without journal
works well.

Cards that plug into a card reader may not be detected. Drives plugged into
SATA interfaces that do not support hot plug (some Dell computers do this)
will not be detected.

To add a medium as an incremental device, run
  backup_sys -i
and follow the prompts.

To add a medium as a full device, run
  backup_sys -f
and follow the prompts.

To add a medium as a var/total device (if running Smoothwall), run
  backup_sys -v
and follow the prompts.

To remove a medium from any list, edit the file 'settings'. There is no
CLI program for this purpose yet.

There is no semi-automated CLI restore mechanism as yet. Until then, use the
following manual procedure:

----snip----
/var/agcl/bin/restore_sys
# plug in backup medium and mount it
# use /var/agcl/bin/tar to extract the files/folders you need to restore
# unmount the backup medium and unplug it
# Type <CTRL/D> or exit to exit the shell and re-enable the daemon.
exit
----snip----

That's all. The rest is plug-n-play.



Hardware notes:
  - the Highpoint 620A, a Marvell card, is not very compatible with the Dell
    Optiplex 390. It worked for a few days, then stopped. The hotplug stopped
    working, and the system wouldn't start grub if a drive was connected to
    the card. The Best Connectivity 2 port SATA II RAID card (1 lane PCI-E),
    while slower, does work well. It is SIL3132 card. The card was needed
    because the Opti-390 doesn't do SATA hotplug.


Reminders:
  - This applies to ordinary GNU/Linux systems. Smoothwall systems typically
    do not have a way to send emails.
  - If you want the system to remind you, create /root/bin/backup_remind with
    the following content:
---SNIP---
#! /bin/bash

export TO="user@host_or_FQDN"
export EMAIL="System Backup <${TO}>"

echo "This is your weekly reminder to be sure my records are backed up.

Be sure to choose the correct medium, be it a monthly (full) or
weekly (incremental) backup.

Your faithful server,
`hostname`
" | \
  /usr/bin/mutt -s "Backup reminder" ${TO}
---SNIP---

    Then run 'crontab -e' and add the following to the end:
---SNIP---
* 11 * * 1 /bin/bash /root/bin/backup_remind
---SNIP---
    to send out a reminder email Monday mornings at 11.
  - The package, mutt, must be installed and configured to send email
    from the localhost.
  - The package, exim4, must be installed and configured to relay email.
