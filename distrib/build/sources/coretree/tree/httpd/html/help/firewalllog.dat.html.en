<P><FONT SIZE='3'><B><U>Firewall Log</U></B></FONT></P>

<P>Like the normal log viewer, you select the date you are interested in
viewing using the drop-down boxes at the top of the page. The body of this
page is made up of a table of packets that were dropped by the firewall.
Included here are the Source and Destination IP addresses and ports, as well
as the protocol involved. Note that not all denied packets are hostile
attempts by crackers to gain access to your machine. Connections to the
ident/auth port (113) are common occurrences and can be ignored.</P>

<P>Every IP address will also have a small arrow and a checkbox.  The arrow
can be used to perform whois lookups and IP blocks from within the firewall
log viewer itself, while with the checkbox you can perform these actions on
a bulk selection of IPs.  The whois function is useful for determining who
is scanning your Smoothwall.</P>

<P>Note, you may also need to use the "Smooth" links at the top of the page
to navigate if there is more than one page meeting the current criteria. 
You may press the <B>Export</B> button to download the log file from your
Smoothwall to your local machine.</P>
