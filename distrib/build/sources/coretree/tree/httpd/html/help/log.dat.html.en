<P>Here you can view the system logs for the different sub-systems
including: PPP logs, DHCP logs, kernel logs, SSH logs, SIP proxy, IM proxy,
web proxy, a general Smoothwall log and the IPSec logs.  The Smoothwall log
shows general Smoothwall events like PPP profile saving. The drop-down boxes
at the top of the page select which day you wish to view.</P>

<P>After choosing the log you wish to view, press <B>Update</B> to see the
selected log.  Note, you may also need to use the "Smooth" links at the top
of the page to navigate if there is more than one page meeting the current
criteria.  You may press the <B>Export</B> button to download the log files
from your Smoothwall to your local machine.</P>

<P>The PPP log is mostly useful for discovering the reason for connection
failures and the like.</P>
