<p>This page is used to configure the IP addresses of the various internal
interfaces, and to configure the external (RED) interface.</p>

<p>The network interfaces displayed will vary depending on which interfaces
have been inserted in the computer running Smoothwall Express, and the
Configuration Type selected in the Setup program's Networking section.</p>

<p>For each of the internal interfaces presented (GREEN, PURPLE and ORANGE),
the <strong>IP address</strong> and <strong>Netmask</strong> can be
configured.  In addition, to aid in NIC identification, the NIC type (make
and model) as well as the MAC address is displayed.</p>

<p>For the external interface, assuming it is configured for Ethernet, you can
set what <strong>Connection method</strong> it should use.  You have a choice
of Static, DHCP or PPPoE.  If you are using DHCP, you can also specify the
DHCP hostname to send when obtaining an IP address from your ISP.</p>

<p>Finally, when configuring RED you can also configure the <strong>Default
gateway</strong>, <strong>Primary DNS</strong> and <strong>Secondary
DNS</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This page supplements the functionality
provided by the Setup program.</p>
