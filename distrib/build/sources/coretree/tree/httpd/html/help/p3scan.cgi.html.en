<p>Smoothwall is able to Anti-Virus (AV) scan POP3 emails as they are downloaded
from external mail servers to clients running on the GREEN and PURPLE network.</p>

<p>No configuration is needed - simply <strong>Enable</strong> the service.
Clients which download mail using POP3, on port 110, will then have all of their
emails AV scanned by Smoothwall's in-built ClamAV engine.  Emails which 
contain a virus will be replaced with an explanation email containing details
of the email including the name of the detected virus.</p>

<p>AV signatures are automatically updated daily.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> POP3 over SSL, on port 995, is not currently
supported by this service.</p>
