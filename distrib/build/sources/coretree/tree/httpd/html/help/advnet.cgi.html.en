<P><STRONG>Block ICMP Ping</STRONG> stops Express responding to PING messages,
from either the Internet or from the  local (GREEN) network.  Like SYN attacks
described below, it is possible to perform a Denial of Service attack by 
flooding a box with PING messages.</P>

<P><STRONG>Block and ignore IGMP packets</STRONG> blocks and ignores IGMP packets. 
If your log files contain lots of spurious  messages referring to IGMP packets,
then enabling this option will cause these packets to be ignored and not to  be
logged. This problem is typically seen with cable modems.</P>

<P><STRONG>Enable SYN cookies</STRONG> defends Express against SYN Flood
attacks.  A SYN Flood attack is where  somebody sends a huge number of
connection requests (SYN packets) to a machine in the hope that it will be 
overwhelmed trying to make so many connections.  SYN cookies is a standard
defence mechanism against this  sort of attack, the aim being to avoid a Denial
of Service (DOS) situation where the machine is too busy to do any  real
work.</P>

<P>Some ISPs configure their users to receive multi-cast messages on network
address 224.0.0.0.  Enabling the <STRONG>Block and ignore multicast traffic</STRONG>
option will block such multi-cast messages and stop them being logged which
can otherwise fill the log files with useless entries.</P>

<P><STRONG>Enable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) support</STRONG> will
enable support for UPnP clients. UPnP will be available on both the GREEN
and the PURPLE networks, if a PURPLE network has been configured.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Action to perform on bad external traffic</STRONG> drop-down
is used to put the Smoothwall Express into a kind of "stealth mode".
In the <B>Reject</B> mode, traffic that is not forwarded on to a machine
behind the Smoothwall will be replied to with a "port unreachable" ICMP
message.  This will make it easier for an attacker to determine what ports
the Smoothwall has open.  In <B>Drop</B> mode, this ICMP message is not sent
so the attacker will have a harder time finding open ports on the
Smoothwall. For maximum "stealth ability", combine <B>Drop</B> mode with
<B>Block ICMP ping</B>.</P>
