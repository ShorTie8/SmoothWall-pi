<P>Smoothwall may optionally run a DHCP server, and this is where it is
configured.</P>

<P>Both the GREEN and PURPLE interfaces can have DHCP service.  Select
the <B>Interface</B> you wish to configure and then press <B>Select</B>.

<P>A feature that is applied globally is network booting.  This requires
a compatible target PC or other device.  Configure the <B>Boot server</B> to
the IP address of the server running TFTP.  Next, choose the <B>Boot filename</B>
and <B>Root path</B> of the file that the PC or other device should boot.  This
feature is intended to be used by diskless workstations, and similar.</P>

<P><STRONG>Start Address</STRONG> and <STRONG>End Address</STRONG> set the range over which you wish the DHCP
server to supply dynamic addresses. This address range should not contain
the IPs of other machines on your LAN with static IP assignments. Suppose
you had a network in the 192.168.0.0 range. Assuming all your statically
assigned IP address were all lower then 192.168.0.100, you could use the
upper portion of the address range for the dynamic addresses. In this case,
your start address would be 192.168.0.100 and the end address could be
192.168.0.254.</P>

<P>The two DNS servers' addresses specify what the DHCP server should tell
its clients to use for their DNS server. Because Smoothwall runs a DNS
proxy, you will probably want to leave the default alone and set the Primary
DNS server to the Smoothwall box's IP address. If you run a local DNS server
and want your desktops to use it, set the Secondary DNS to its address.</P>

<P>The two NTP servers' addresses specify which NTP servers the
Smoothwall DHCP server should tell its clients to use. This can be used
to configure the network hosts to time-sync with the Smoothwall's (or other
server's) system time.</P>

<P>The two WINS servers' addresses, likewise, specify what WINS servers the
Smoothwall DHCP server should tell its clients to use. This is often not
required on very small Windows networks. You can assign primary and
secondary servers.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Default</STRONG> and <STRONG>Maximum lease times</STRONG> can be left at their
default values unless you have specific needs.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Domain name suffix</STRONG> sets the domain name that the DHCP server
will give to the client.  There should not be a leading period in this
box.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>NIS domain</STRONG> sets the NIS domain that the server will
give to the clients. This should not be confused with the <STRONG>
Domain name suffix</STRONG>, described above.</P>

<P>The two NIS servers' addresses, likewise, specify what NIS servers the
Smoothwall DHCP server should tell its clients to use. This is useful
in UNIX environments which are utilising NIS.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Add a new static assignment</STRONG> section is used to allocate a
fixed IP addresses for nominated clients.  It does this by reference to the
client NIC's (LAN Card) MAC (Media Access Control) address.  Use this
facility if you want a certain PC or Apple Macintosh to always get the same
IP address, as if it was configured with a static IP address.  The contents
of the <STRONG>Description</STRONG> text box are not used by the system, they are
there to help you identify the IP assignments with a human intelligible
string, such as Reception PC, Mark's MAC etc.</P>

<P>Note the MAC address must be entered as six pairs of hexadecimal numbers,
with a space, colon or other separator character between each pair, e.g. 
<code>12 34 56 78 9A BC</code> or 
<code>12:34:56:78:9A:BC</code>.  Click the <STRONG>Add</STRONG> button and the MAC
and IP Address pair will be displayed in the Current static assignments
section below.  In order to edit an existing static IP address assignment,
click or select the Mark checkbox alongside the required MAC and IP Address
pair, then press Remove to delete the assignment or <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> to move the
MAC and IP Address pairing back to the new static assignment section above. 
In the case of pressing Edit, change the MAC or IP address as required then
press the Add button again to return the revised assignment to the Current
static assignments section below.</P>

<P>Enable the DHCP server by checking the <STRONG>Enable</STRONG> checkbox. 
This will enable DHCP service for the selected interface. When you
press <STRONG>Save</STRONG>, the change is acted upon.</P>
