<P>This page is used for setting up allowed connections from external
machines to a given port on the Smoothwall, provided that the connection is
made directly to the Smoothwall host.  Ports opened for forwarding are not
affected by the settings on this page.  <B>Note:</B> This is a subtle change
from previous versions of Smoothwall where a port forward was created on the
port forward page, and opened on the External access page.</P>

<P>Set the protocol (TCP or UDP) using the drop-down box.</P>

<P><B>Source IP</B> sets the allowed IP that you want to be able to connect
to the <B>Destination port</B>.  If this is empty, which is usually the
case, all external hosts are allowed to connect.  The Source IP can be
either a host or a network, and is specified as 192.168.0.1 (a host),
192.168.0.0/24 (a network), or 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 (also a network).
You are able to specify multiple Source IPs, so you can easily allow certain
IPs and combinations of networks to connect to a single port on the
Smoothwall.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Smoothwall comes with one "built in" rule. It will allow
Auth (port 113) packets.  This is only to stop Auth requests from being logged in
the firewall; there is no Auth service running on Smoothwall. If you
have reason to log these requests, simply disable (or remove) the entry in
the External access configuration.</P>
