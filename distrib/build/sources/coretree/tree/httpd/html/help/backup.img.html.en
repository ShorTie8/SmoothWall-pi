<P>The backup page is used to invoke a backup of Smoothwall Express's
configuration information to a floppy disk.  Should it prove necessary, at
some later time, the backup floppy disk can be used during the installation
process to create a new Smoothwall Express using the saved configuration
information.  This is especially useful for either cloning Smoothwall Express
systems (e.g. making facsimiles).  It also allows a Smoothwall Express system to
be installed by somebody who has no knowledge of how to configure a firewall
and Internet gateway.</P>

<P>The information is recorded to a floppy disk that should be loaded into the
floppy disk drive of the Smoothwall Express system, not the workstation PC
running the web browser being used to initiate the backup.  The floppy disk
should contain no existing data but must be DOS formatted.</P>

<P>Click the <STRONG>Create backup floppy disk</STRONG> button to create the backup
disk.  This may take some time to complete and it is possible that the
'Backup disk created successfully' message may appear before the floppy disk
write operations are complete.  Do not remove the floppy disk from the
Smoothwall Express until the activity LED on the drive is no longer
illuminated.</P>

<P>It is also possible to create a floppy disk image file, and have it
sent over the network to the web browser.  This is useful
if the Smoothwall Express is not physically available, and you wish to
take a backup of the settings.  Press the <STRONG>Create backup floppy
disk image</STRONG> to create a backup floppy disk image file.  This image
can then be written to a floppy disk prior to reinstallation.</P>
