<P>This page contains a collection of traffic statistics and graphs detailing
traffic conditions as recorded by the server.  Initially, these graphs
indicate traffic on the <b>GREEN</b>, <b>ORANGE</b> (if configured) and
<b>RED</b> interfaces over the last day.  </p>

<P>At the top of this page two sets of traffic statistics are shown: one lists traffic
statistics for each network interface in the Smoothwall, and the other lists
traffic statistics per network IP address. Traffic statistics are retained
for two months and show byte counts for incoming and outgoing directions,
with totals recorded for the current and previous hour, day, week and month.
Also, approximate current rates are shown.</P>

<p>Also present on this page is a series of graphs. Clicking on one of the
graphs itself will then further detail traffic and this interface, covering
the last day, week, month and year.</p>

<p>For all graphs, graphs show traffic on the given interface, in
both the incoming and outgoing directions.  The maximum, minimum,
current and average speed per second is also displayed on a graph by
graph basis.  The data for these graphs is correlated every 5
minutes.</p>
