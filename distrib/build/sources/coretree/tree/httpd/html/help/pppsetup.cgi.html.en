<P><FONT SIZE='3'><B><U>PPP Settings</U></B></FONT></P>

<P>This page is used to setup PPP for dialing to the Internet. Up to 5 profiles
can be created to store dialup details.</P>

<P><B>Profiles:</B> Profiles can either be 'Empty' or can contain dialup
details. Pressing the <B>Save</B> button stores the settings in the current
profile. To create a profile, give it a name and after entering the details,
click Save. You can create additional profiles by choosing an empty profile
from the list and entering the new details, before pressing Save. Use
<B>Select</B> to make a profile the current one for dialing from the main
page. You cannot select an empty profile; instead, simply choose it from the
list and save your new details to it. You can delete a profile with the
<B>Delete</B> button; this will make the previously selected profile the new
currently selected one.</P>

<P><B>Telephony:</B> A drop-down box sets the modem COM port. COM1 through to
COM4 are available. Depending on the computer and BIOS setup, you should set
this to the COM port that is connected to the modem. Enter your ISP's dial-in
access modem number into the number box. It should contain only digits, no
hyphens.</P>

<P><B>USB Cellular modem:</B> A drop-down box sets the modem COM port. Choose one of
USB Serial 0 through USB Serial 7. Depending on the modem, you will typically
select USB Serial 2, USB Serial 1 or USB Serial 0. You may have to
try several times until you find the correct device. You may or may not need
to use a dial-in number or code. Note that any baud rate you select should
be ignored because is it not relevant to these devices.
</P>

<P>If you are connecting by ISDN, PPPoE or USB ADSL, you should choose the
relevant method as your connection <B>Interface</B>.</P>

<P><B>The Computer to modem rate</B> drop-down box sets the baud rate between the
computer and the modem. Usually, the second highest setting, 115200, will
suffice and give the highest available download speed from your ISP, but on
very old computers with old serial controllers, you may need to select a
slower speed.  If you are using dual channel ISDN on an external ISDN TA,
you may choose to use the highest setting, although you should be aware that
this requires a powerful CPU in your Smoothwall. Note that the baud rate is
usually ignored when using a USB cellular modem.</P>

<P>The <B>Persistent Connection</B> checkbox is used to instruct Smoothwall
to try to re-dial the line if the link fails for some reason. Use this with
caution.  If you have metered charges, you probably not want to use this.
However, if you have unlimited service time with your ISP, you will probably
want to use this in order to keep the link connected as much as
possible.</P>

<P>Whether or not <B>Persistent</B> is enabled, if more then the <B>Maximum
Retries</B> number of dial attempts fail in a row, Smoothwall will give up
until you try to dial the link again by pressing the <B>Dial</B> button.</P>

<P>You can choose Tone or Pulse dialing using the drop-down box. A checkbox
is also provided for enabling or disabling the modem's speaker during
dialing.</P>

<P>The <B>Idle timeout</B> setting, when used in non-persistent connections,
sets a time of inactivity, after which the line will automatically be
dropped. Setting this to 0 disables this timeout.</P>

<P><B>Dial on Demand</B> is available by clicking the relevant checkboxes. After
enabling Dial on Demand, you still have to click the <B>Connect</B> button
on the home page to start Smoothwall waiting for an outgoing request.  The
<B>Dial on Demand for DNS</B> option will make Smoothwall dial for DNS
requests, which is usually what you want.</P>

<P><B>Connect on Smoothwall Restart</B> will make Smoothwall connect after booting.
This is especially useful in Dial on Demand mode, because it will
automatically put the system into Dial on Demand waiting mode each time the
Smoothwall machine is switched on.</P>

<P><B>ISP Requires Carriage Return:</B> Most ISP require that the modem send a carriage
return to signal it has finished sending.  Default is unchecked.</P>

<P><B>Authentication:</B> <B>Username</B> and <B>Password</B> are the
username and password that your ISP should have supplied to you when you
joined.</P>

<P>There are several ways in which ISPs use this username and password to login
to their systems. The most common methods are PAP or CHAP. Select this if
your ISP uses either of those two. If your ISP uses a text-based login
script, choose standard login script. For people in the UK who use Demon
Internet as their ISP, a special script has been created for them to use.
The "Other" login script option has been provided for people who have ISPs
with special needs. If you need to do this, you will need to login to the
Smoothwall box and create a file in /etc/ppp. This filename (without the
/etc/ppp component) should be entered into the Script name box. The file
contains 'expect send' pairs, separated by a tab. <B>USERNAME</B> will be
substituted for the username and <B>PASSWORD</B> for the password. Examine the file
demonloginscript in /etc/ppp, and use it as an example of what should be in
this file.</P>

<P><B>DNS:</B> Here you can either enter the IP addresses of your ISP's DNS
servers, or select <B>Automatic</B> if your ISP supports automatic DNS server
configuration, which nearly all ISPs do.</P>

<P>Click <B>Save</B> to save the settings. If there are errors, you will be
informed in the Error messages box.</P>
