<P>Smoothwall is able to forward incoming connection requests to machines
that are behind it, on either the DMZ (ORANGE) network or on the local
(GREEN or PURPLE) network. Those behind a dialup link probably do not
require this feature, although it is still available to them.</P>

<P>Securitywise, it is extremely risky to put your externally visible
servers on your GREEN or PURPLE network because a cracker who manages to
break into such a server will afterwards have access to your entire local
network. It is therefore prudent to use an additional network (a DMZ or
De-Militarised Zone on the ORANGE interface), just for the purpose of
serving external requests.</P>

<P>Note that the connection is only forwarded if the <B>External source
IP</B> matches.  If you leave this field blank, then any host on the outside
will be able to utilise the forward.</P>

<P>When an Internet host connects to this port, the connection will be
forwarded to a host behind Smoothwall. The connection can be directed to any
IP address and port. For example, suppose you wish to run a web server behind
your Smoothwall. The web server is on your DMZ, at IP address 192.168.2.60.
You would forward from port 80, connecting again to port 80 on the
192.168.2.60.</P>

<p>Ports may be specified either manually using a <strong>User defined</strong>
port, or from a list in the <strong>Port or range</strong> drop-down.</p>

<P>To forward a range of ports, use the format A:B for the <B>Source
port</B>. If a <B>Destination port</B> is not given, then the same port
will be used on the target. So, forwarding, say 6667:7000 with
no destination will use the same port as the connection was made for the
target. The alternative is to specify a port on the destination. So, if you
were to forward 6667:7000 to 7000, every connection on that
port range would be on 7000. It is not possible to map a port range to
another port range. Note that not specifying a destination
port works equally well for a single Source port.</P>
