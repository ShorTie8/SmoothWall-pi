<P>Here you can view the usage logs of your web proxy server. You can select
what you want to view with the options at the top of the page. You may
select the day, month and the source IP (the machine within your network) to
view the logs for. As well as this, you may also use regular expressions
to filter certain lines from the log. The default has been set to strip all
images, etc. and should normally be sufficient.</P>

<P>You must use the <B>Update</B> button to activate any choices.  Note, you
may also need to use the "Smooth" links at the top of the page to navigate
if there is more than one page meeting the current criteria. You may press
the <B>Export</B> button to download the log file from your Smoothwall to
your local machine.</P>
