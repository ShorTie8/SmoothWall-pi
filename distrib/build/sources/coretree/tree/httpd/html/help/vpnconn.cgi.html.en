<P>This page is used to do basic VPN configuration. To find out more about
VPNs, please visit the FreeSWAN web site <A
HREF='http://www.freeswan.org'>here</A>.</P> Although primarily intended to
VPN multiple Smoothwalls together, it is possible for Smoothwall to
inter-operate with any VPN product that supports IPSec and standard encryption
techniques such as 3DES.</P>

<P><B>Add a New Connection</B>: To add a new connection, you must fill out
all the boxes in this form and the details filled into the form on the other
end must match <B>EXACTLY</B> with yours. This is why the Import and Export
features are useful. Fields are as follows:</P>

<P><B>Name:</B> A simple name to reference this connection.  Use lower case
letters only.</P>

<P><B>Left/Right:</B> The internet IP address of the Left/Right side of the
connection.</P>

<P><B>Left/Right subnet:</B> The network of the left/right hand side (e.g.
192.168.0.0/24 would include 192.168.0.*).</P>

<P><B>Secret:</B> The password for the connection.
Re-enter the secret into the <B>Again</B> box.</P>

<P><B>Compression:</B> Check this to enable compression on the link.  This
can enhance the performance of the link for certain kinds of traffic.  Note
that both ends of the VPN tunnel must agree on whether to use compression or
not.</P>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Optionally you may enter a description or comment for the
tunnel.</p>

<P>To add the connection, fill in all fields and click the <B>Add</B>
button. If you wish to add the connection without enabling it, please
uncheck the <B>Enabled</B> box.</P>

<P><B>Current Connections:</B> This list displays current connections and
their information. To remove a connection, check its checkbox and click the
<B>Remove</B> button. To edit (including enable/disable functions), check the
connections checkbox and then click the <B>Edit</B> button.</P>

<P><B>Import/Export:</B> To export settings, simply click the <B>Export</B> button.
These can then be imported to Smoothwall by using the <B>Browse</B> button to find
the saved file on your hard rive and uploading it using the form by using the
<B>Import</B> button to upload them to your Smoothwall.  This is best used by
exporting your settings and sending them to the person at the other end of
your VPN connection to import to ensure all settings match.  Note that the
export file contains the VPN secret information, so you must ensure that the
file is transfered securely!  Either put it on a floppy disk and mail it, or
use a secure Internet link such as a PGP encrypted mail or https to the
other Smoothwall.</P>
