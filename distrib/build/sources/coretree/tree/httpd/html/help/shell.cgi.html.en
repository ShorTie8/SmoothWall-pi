<P><FONT SIZE='3'><B><U>JAVA SSH Shell Client</U></B></FONT></P>

<P>This page is used to give the user a Java-based SSH Shell to the
Smoothwall Express.  This allows for administration, maintenance, setup,
and backup.</P>

<P><B>SSH Shell:</B> This page is activated by checking the <B>SSH</B> box
on the <B>Remote Access</B> page of your Smoothwall.  If <B>SSH</B> is
enabled, this page can be used to remotely log on to the Smoothwall via a
secure Java based SSH (Secure Shell) client built directly into the
Smoothwall platform.  Here, the administrator can perform routine duties
such as maintenance, tweaking various system parameters, monitoring network and
platform performance, backing up logs, etc.  The SSH client provides the
necessary CLI (Command Line Interface) to the underlying Linux system that
makes up the Smoothwall platform.  It is advisable that prior to using this
interface, new users or users unfamiliar with Linux or Unix consult either
the Man Pages, the various Unix or Linux How-To's, or any of the many
quality Linux and Unix books available.</P>

<P>The client will first ask you to enter the hostname to which you
wish to connect. You should simply press return to accept the default, which
is to connect back to the Smoothwall box. You should then enter the name of
the user (<B>"root"</B> or <B>"setup"</B>) you wish to login as.</P>

<P><B>"root"</B>: This is the shell user and provides full access to the Smoothwall
shell.</P>

<P><B>"setup"</B>: This user account is used for running the setup program.
Login as 'setup', give the correct password, and you will be placed straight
into the setup program for reconfiguring the hostname, networks, ISDN,
and passwords.  This is an extremely important feature, as it allows you
to reconfigure your Smoothwall without reinstalling.</P>

<P>Note that it may take a moment for the SSH client to be downloaded and
initialised, and that you <B><I>must have Java enabled</I></B> in your
browser for the Java SSH Shell Client to operate.<P>

<P><strong>WARNING:</strong> Accessing the SSH client and
logging into the Smoothwall allows the user to modify any and all files.
This can result in loss of connectivity, reduced security, or the need to
reinstall Smoothwall. <strong>You have been
warned.</strong></P>
