<p>Smoothwall has the ability to run an Instant Messenger (IM) proxy that
understands multiple IM protocols and can log both conversations and file
transfers. This proxy, like all of the proxies in Smoothwall, will operate
on both the GREEN and PURPLE networks if it is enabled.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox to turn on this service.
It is possible to filter English swearwords by checking on the
<strong>Swear-word filtering</strong> checkbox.</p>

<p><strong>MSN</strong>, <strong>ICQ and AIM</strong>,
<strong>Yahoo</strong>, <strong>IRC</strong>, <strong>Gadu-Gadu</strong>
and <strong>Jabber and Gtalk</strong> can all be proxied and monitored using
this service.</p>

<p>To log and record connections protocected with SSL (which includes Gtalk
and AIM when used with SSL), <strong>SSL Man-In-The-Middle attack</strong>
must be enabled.  This will proxy the connection with an on-the-fly
certificate, signed with a built in Certificate Authority.  In order for
this connection to be treated as trusted, export the certificate by pressing
the <strong>Download CA certificate</strong> button, and load it into the
client.  Without loading the CA certificate, the proxied on-the-fly
certificate may be rejected by the client.</strong>

<p>Press the <strong>Save</strong> button after enabling or disabling this
service.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This proxy cannot monitor HTTP-based IM
sessions.</p>
