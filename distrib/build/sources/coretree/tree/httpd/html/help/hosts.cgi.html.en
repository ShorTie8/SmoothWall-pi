<P>The Static DNS configuration page creates a local Hostname table that can be
used by both the Smoothwall Express and computers on the GREEN and PURPLE
networks.</P>

<P>Type the IP address you wish to be resolved into the <STRONG>IP address</STRONG> text
box.  Alongside this control is the <STRONG>Hostname</STRONG> text box, which should
contain the name by which you wish to access the IP address.</P>

<P>Click the <STRONG>Add</STRONG> button and the information will be transferred to the
Current hosts section below, with the Add a host entry controls being cleared,
ready for the entry of the next host's details.  There is no Save button, all 
changes take effect immediately the Add button is clicked, unless of course,
there is a validation failure, which will be reported in the Error messages
panel or a by a pop-up error message according to how the preferences have 
been set.</P>

<P>The hostname will now be resolvable to all hosts utilising the DNS server that
resides on the Smoothwall.  This includes the Smoothwall itself.</P>

<P>You can also <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> and <STRONG>Delete</STRONG> entries in a similar way to other
Smoothwall Express pages.</P>
