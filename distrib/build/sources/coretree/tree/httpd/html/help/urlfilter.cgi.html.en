<p>
Smoothwall Express' URL Filter feature allows admins to block web pages based
on the contents of the URL or parts of the URL. In stock form, it works only
with HTTP; it cannot monitor the data inside SSL-encrypted HTTPS accesses.
There is a mod available that allows the proxy to decrypt and recrypt HTTPS
connections.
</p>
<p>
Smoothwall can download and deploy categorized blacklists of web sites via
the built-in SquidGuard web proxy plugin.  This allows the admin to block
access to different categories of web sites; for example, the Shalla Secure
Services blacklist has almost 80 categories that can be blocked individually.
The admin can block certains types of files, such as executables. Internal IP
addresses can be allowed unfiltered access or they can be blocked from
accessing web sites. There are more option that allow the admin to more finely
control which systems can access which web sites.

</p>
<p>
Several of these boxes are included in the display for the admin's convenience.
</p>

<h3>Custom blacklist</h3>
<p>
These fields allow the admin to block specified domains (FQDNs) and specific
URLs.  Select the <b>Enable</b> checkbox to enable these blacklisted hosts and
sites. Enter one domain name per line in the <u>Blocked domains</u> box. Enter
one URL per line in the <u>Blocked URLs</u> box. Click <b>Save</b> or <b>Save
and restart</b> to save the changes or to save and re-run SquidGuard, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Custom whitelist</h3>
<p>
These fields allow the admin to allow specified domains (FQDNs) and specific
URLs.  Select the <b>Enable</b> checkbox to enable these whitelisted hosts and
sites. Enter one domain name per line in the <u>Allowed domains</u> box. Enter
one URL per line in the <u>Allowed URLs</u> box. Click <b>Save</b> or <b>Save
and restart</b> to save the changes or to save and re-run SquidGuard, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Custom expression list</h3>
<p>
This field allows the admin to block specific URLs using regular expressions. 
For example, <i>.*[Dd][Oo][Oo][Bb].*</i> would block every URL that contains
the letters 'doob' in uppercase, lowercase or mixed case. Internal hosts could
not perform web searches for 'doob', visit any site that contains 'doob' in
the hostname, or visit any URL that contains 'doob' anywhere in it. This
includes information on people named Doob, doobies, The Doobie Brothers, and
Doob 3D printing. It's powerful but, as with all uses of regular expressions,
it can wide reaching effects.

Select the <b>Enable</b> checkbox to enable these blocked expressions. Enter
one regular expression per line in the <u>Blocked expressions</u> box. Click
<b>Save</b> or <b>Save and restart</b> to save the changes or to save and
re-run SquidGuard, respectively.
