<P>This page enables the administrator to selectively block external IP
addresses from accessing the Smoothwall and any machines behind it.</P>

<P>Enter the remote <STRONG>Source IP</STRONG> for the machine you want to
block.  There are several different ways to block:</P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Drop packet:</STRONG> this will cause any request
from the given IP to be completely ignored.  The effect is similar to
if the Smoothwall was unplugged from its network.
<LI><STRONG>Reject packet:</STRONG> in this mode, an ICMP
Connection Refused message will be sent back to the originating IP, but
no connection will be possible.
</UL>

<P>Additionally, it is possible to log the packet, or not.</P>

<P>Please note that this functionality is intended for the
external (RED) network only.</P>
