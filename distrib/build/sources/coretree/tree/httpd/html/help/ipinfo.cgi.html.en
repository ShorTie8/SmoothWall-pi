<P>The Whois page is used to display the ownership information for an IP
address or domain name.  A major use within Smoothwall Express is to determine
the source of messages that are appearing in the firewall or Intrusion
Detection System logs, i.e. the source of possible hacking attempts.</P>

<P>Enter the IP address or domain name into IP addresses or domain names
text box and click the Run button.  The results of the Whois command are
displayed in the panel below the user-input controls.  The output is
defendant on the item being queried.  Typically, it will show the owner of
the IP block for the IP address in question, including such things as
company names, addresses, etc. If you are looking up a domain name, it will
show the owner of that name. It is, of course, generally far more convenient
to run the command from this configuration and management procedure.</P>
