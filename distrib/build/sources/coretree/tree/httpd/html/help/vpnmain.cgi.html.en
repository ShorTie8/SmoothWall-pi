<P><FONT SIZE='3'><B><U>VPN Control and Status</U></B></FONT></P>

<p>Although primarily intended to VPN multiple Smoothwalls together, it is
possible for Smoothwall to inter-operate with any VPN product that supports
IPSec and standard encryption techniques such as 3DES.</P>

<P>The <B>Manual Control and Status</B> section will show the current status
of any VPN tunnels. To stop all VPN tunnels click the <B>Stop</B> button. To
restart (in case of failure) please click the <B>Restart</B> button.</P>

<P><B>Local VPN IP:</B> Under this option, you may specify your local VPN
IP address to listen on. Most people will not want to enable this. If left
untouched, your VPN IP will be set to that of your RED interface, which is
what almost all people will want.</P>

<P>This IP address is used if your Smoothwall is on a dialup connection. 
Only if the dialup IP matches this IP will the VPN be brought up
automatically.  This is so you can use multiple ISP profiles, but control which
one if them is to be associated with your VPN configuration.</P>

<P>The <B>Enable</B> checkbox will tell Smoothwall to automatically bring up
the Enabled VPN tunnels when the RED interface comes up.  Even when
disabled, it is still possible to manually bring up the tunnels.</P>
