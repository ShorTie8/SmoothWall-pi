.SH NAME
beep2 \- ring beep sounds with various frequency/length.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ti -.5i
.B beep2
\%[-dfs]
\%[-t tempo]
\%[file]
.LP
.B beep2

.in -.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page is for \fIbeep2\fR from \fIbeep\fR by Josef Pavlik (jetset@ibm.net).
.LP
\fIbeep2\fR accepts frequency (or score) and length from stdin or text file, and translates to beep sounds. The input format is descripted at
.B INPUT FORMAT
section.
.SS OPTION
.TP
.I "\-d"
Debug mode. \fIbeep2\fR outputs various messages.
.TP
.I "\-f"
Frequency input mode(default). \fIbeep2\fR uses frequency as input. This fuction is the same as \fIconsole beep V0.1\fR.
.TP
.I "\-s"
Score input mode. \fIbeep2\fR uses score as input. Score is constructed with set of alphabet and number (includes #).
.TP
.I "\-t tempo"
Tempo change. \fIbeep2\fR changes tempo into \fItempo\fR %. The default \fItempo\fR value is 100.
.TP
.I "\-v"
Show the version of this program and the infomation of included functions, then exit.
.SH INPUT FORMAT
\fIbeep2\fR parses line to line. A line begins with # or empty is parsed as a comment and ignored. A string after length block is parsed as a comment and ignored too. Other line is composed as 2 fields separated with space or tab. A line does not match this format is ignored. A 0 frequency input line is parsed as no sound (rest).
.SS FREQUENCY INPUT MODE
At this mode, the first field is frequency in Hz, and the second field is length in milliseconds. For example:
.nf
.in +.5i
#!/usr/bin/beep2 -d

1046    200     # C6
1046    100     # C6
0       100     # rest
.in -.5i
.fi
.SS SCORE INPUT MODE
At this mode, the first field is score which constructed with alphabet and number (and #), and the second field is length in milliseconds. For example:
.nf
.in +.5i
#!/usr/bin/beep2 -ds

C6      200     # C6
C6      100     # C6
C6#     100     # C6#
---     100     # rest
.in -.5i
.fi
\fIbeep2\fR can parse octaves from 1 to 9, and parse score from C1 to B9. The rest syntax is \*(lq\-\*(rq.
.SH LIMITATION
\fIbeep2\fR makes beep sound with escape sequence code. So, \fIbeep2\fR has limitation below.
.SS I cannot hear under about 20 Hz and over about 20000 Hz sound.
This is human limitation. Some animals hear sound.
.SS I cannot set under C1 or over B9.
This is program and human limitation.
.SS I cannot hear under about 10 ms sound.
The program spends about 10 ms to change frequency.
.SS I cannot hear over 2000 ms on Linux.
This is the limitation of Linux kernel console driver. If you get source package, please use "longbeep-linux.patch" kernel patch. If you use this patch, the limitation is released and the kernel is expanded to deal length to 9999 ms.
.SH LOGGING FUNCTION
\fIbeep2\fR is added logging function since version 1.2. You can use this function if you enable it when you compile this program.
.LP
The log is sent to syslog at user.info priority. Generally, it is written to /var/log/messages. It includes the information of executed real user name and executed command string.
.LP
If you want to change log file, you need to edit syslog.conf (generally placed at /etc) and configure. The detail is in syslog documents.
.SH WARNING
\fIbeep2\fR installs as root setuid-ed. Please consider with seculity policy and set execute attribute for trasted users only.
.SH BUG
This program is not tested enoughly. I seem to be contained many bugs. If you see buggy behavior, please tell the author of \fIbeep2\fR.
